### Important!
I don't start this project from scratch, I take the base code from the [Adrian Hajdin repository](https://github.com/adrianhajdin). This man has an amazing  youtube channel [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) with amazing content. All base project credits for him <3.
